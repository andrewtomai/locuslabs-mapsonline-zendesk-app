# Maps Online by LocusLabs

This integration is included as part of a LocusLabs MapsOnline Subscription.

The LocusLabs MapsOnline app for Zendesk provides higher quality support by displaying a map that can show your agents the location of concern while they serve customers in Zendesk.

The application uses your LocusLabs Account ID to show a map of your venue on the ZenDesk Ticket.

## Improve customer satisfaction with high fidelity conversations
* Solve chats and tickets faster by having access to relevant location information, such as venue, floor, and precise lat/lng, from within Zendesk.
* Interact with your venue map to better understand the context of your requester.
